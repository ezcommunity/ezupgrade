ABOUT

eZUpgrade is stand-alone application (not an eZ Publish extension) automating
the process of upgrading an eZ Publish installation.

eZUpgrade works by checking out on the server where the upgraded installation
will reside, inputing some configuration settings, and running ezupgrade
from the command line.


HOW IT WORKS

The old eZ Publish installation can be located either on the same server as
the upgraded installation, or on a remote server. If the latter is the case,
eZUpgrade will make use of eZCopy to copy the old installation to the new
server before starting the upgrade procedure.

eZUpgrade then performs the following steps:

1. Downloads and unpacks the distro of the version we want to upgrade to.

2. Copies files (var/, settings/ and extension/) from the old to the 
   new installation, prompting when overrides are needed.
   
3. Copies the databases used by the old installation and updates the 
   database connections in the new installation to the db copies.

4. Performs the upgrade steps needed between the version we are upgrading
   from and the version we are upgrading to. This includes sql updates,
   upgrade scripts and any other upgrade actions that can be performed
   automatically. If there are any upgrade actions that need to be performed
   manually, you will be informed.
   
5. Grant the database user access to the new database(s).


REQUIREMENTS

* eZUpgrade is dependent upon eZCopy (http://projects.ez.no/ezcopy) and its
  requirements.


INSTALLATION

* Check out ezupgrade to the server where the upgraded installation will reside.

* Check out ezcopy (http://projects.ez.no/ezcopy) to the /lib folder of ezupgrade
  (making the directory /lib/ezcopy) and and follow its installation instructions.
  Finally, copy the ezcopy.ini file from lib/ezcopy/settings/ to settings/  
  
* Copy settings/account_default.ini and rename the copy settings/account.ini
  For each account you need to upgrade, create an Account block with the 
  proper settings.
