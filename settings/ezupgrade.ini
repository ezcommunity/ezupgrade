# EXAMPLE ON UPGRADE VERSION BLOCK
#
# The placement of the original eZ distros (including trailing slash)
# Alternative values are a local path, or false if they should be fetched
# from their respective placements as specified in the DownloadURL setting
# of each version
#
# If a path is specified, the file names of each distro should be in the format
# of ezpublish-[version-no]-gpl.tar.gz

# [Upgrade_4.2.0]
# The URL from where the distro can be downloaded
# 
# DownloadURL=http://ez.no/content/download/282761/2618664/version/4/file/ezpublish-4.2.0-full-gpl.tar.gz

# This setting specifices how far back the current version holds upgrade scripts, SQLs
# and the likes. If the version we are upgrading from is older than this, we can not
# upgrade directly, and we need to upgrade to the most recent version which holds upgrade
# data going back further than our current version.

# UpgradeContainerSinceVersion=4.0.0

# Whether or not the version is a maintenance release, meaning that that it there has already
# been release an eZ Publish version in a higher minor version, and that this release is 
# just to fix bugs in the current minor.
#
# MaintenanceRelease=false

# A list of requirements for this version. This could be things like version of PHP, 
# eZ Components, or other server requirements. The checks for requirements should be defined
# as methods in classes/requirements.php
# 
# Requirements[]=PHP5
# Requirements[]=eZC20082

# A list of upgrade functions that need to be run. Upgrade functions need to be
# created for each upgrade script, and any other changes that need to be applied
# for the current version. Upgrade functions should be created as methods in 
# classes/upgradefunctions.php
# The second value (after the semicolon) dictates whether or not the function should
# be run depending on the version the user is upgrading from.
# If no value exists, the upgrade function will be run regardless of previous version.
# If a version number is provided, the script will not be run unless the previous version
# is older than the provided version number
